			Campus Life
		</h2>
		<p>
			Here at Durantite University, students and faculty participate in a wide variety of extracarricular activities. 
			Unlike other colleges, however, our teams and groups all come with that patented "Learn-Don't-Earn" mentality.			
		</p>
		<p>
			Students are encouraged to engage in all sorts of group activities, from free-range chicken rearing to interpretive
			mediterranean salsa making. Here, they will be partnered with professionals who are simply dying to make use of 
			their raw talent and ambition and teach them valuable trades for the low, low price of free. Some may call it "unpaid
			labor," but we prefer to think of it as "life experience."

					the pool, replace the filters, and perform checks on chemical balance.</p>
