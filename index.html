			all while under the supervision of active members of the professional community, who combined have more than 10
			million years of experience. Their goals are to guide students to reach their full potential in the short time they
			have to learn. Our patented "Fake-it-til-you-make-it" methodology has lead to our students graduating to real world
			jobs such as CEO of "My Father's Company" and janitor at "A Real Business".

			extracurricular activities. These include the Swimming and Cleaning Team, the Football and Yard Work team, and the Glee
			and Inventory Consortium among many others. In these clubs, they will learn both how to succeed in a real world as well
			as manage expectations that many will have when they begin entering entry level positions.
