						I teach classes in recent US history, Georgia history, and environmental history, and my research interests focus on the 
						environmental and agricultural history of the American South. I am the author of Conserving Southern Longleaf: Herbert 
						Stoddard and the Rise of Ecological Land Management (University of Georgia Press, 2011), and The Art of Managing Longleaf: 
						A Personal History of the Stoddard-Neel Approach (with Leon Neel and Paul Sutter, UGA Press, 2010). I’m currently working 
						on a book-length project tentatively titled “Not Naturally a Grass Country: Environment, Plant Genetics, and the Quest for 
						Agricultural Modernization in the Humid World,” which examines the modern transformation of agricultural landscapes in the 
						American South and other humid regions. Head over to the research link for more of my publications.

						AH coverI also edit the journal Agricultural History, which has been published by the Agricultural History Society since 
						1927. Agricultural History explores agriculture and rural life over time, in all geographies, and among all people. We 
						publish a wide range of articles using many different methodologies to tell stories about the history of farming, agricultural 
						commodities and technologies, environment, the rural experience, and more.
